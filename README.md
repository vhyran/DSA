# Data Structures and Algorithms in Zig

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository implemented in the Zig programming language! This repository serves as a resource for anyone interested in learning about fundamental DSA concepts and their implementations in Zig.

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Zig. The goal is to provide clean, efficient, and well-documented code that serves as both a learning resource and a utility for developers.

## Why Zig?

Zig is a modern programming language designed for simplicity, performance, and reliability. Its features include:
- Manual memory management with safety checks
- No hidden control flow or memory allocations
- Compile-time code execution
- Interoperability with C

These features make Zig a great choice for implementing efficient and predictable data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Version
- 0.13.0

### Documentation
You can find the official Zig [documentation](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.13.0). This documentation provides comprehensive information about the Zig programming language, including its syntax, features, and standard library.

### Prerequisites
Install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) on your system.

### Compiling and Running Code
To compile and run an implementation:

```bash
zig build-exe <filename>.zig
./<filename>
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If youâ€™d like to add a new data structure, algorithm, or improve existing implementations, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/<your-feature>`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/<your-feature>`.
5. Submit a pull request.

Ensure your code follows the Zig coding standards and includes appropriate comments and test cases.
