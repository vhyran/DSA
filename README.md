# Data Structures and Algorithms in Zig

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository implemented in the Zig programming language! This repository serves as a resource for anyone interested in learning about fundamental DSA concepts and their implementations in Zig.

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Zig. The goal is to provide clean, efficient, and well-documented code that serves as both a learning resource and a utility for developers.

## Why Zig?

Zig is a modern programming language designed for simplicity, performance, and reliability. Its features include:
- Manual memory management with safety checks
- No hidden control flow or memory allocations
- Compile-time code execution
- Interoperability with C

These features make Zig a great choice for implementing efficient and predictable data structures and algorithms.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures
- [x] Arrays
- [x] Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly and Circular)
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues (Simple and Circular)

### Non-Linear Data Structures
- [ ] Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
- [ ] Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- [ ] Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)

### Hashing
- [ ] Hash Tables

## Implemented Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- [ ] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Heap Sort

### Searching Algorithms
- [ ] Linear Search
- [ ] Binary Search

### Graph Algorithms
- [ ] Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- [ ] Depth-First Search (DFS)
- [ ] Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- [ ] Kruskal’s Algorithm
- [ ] Prim’s Algorithm

### Other Algorithms
- [ ] Dynamic Programming (Examples: Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem)
- [ ] Divide and Conquer (Examples: Merge Sort, Binary Search)
- [ ] Backtracking (Examples: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)

## Getting Started

### Version
- 0.13.0

### Documentation
You can find the official Zig [documentation](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.13.0). This documentation provides comprehensive information about the Zig programming language, including its syntax, features, and standard library.

### Prerequisites
Install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) on your system.

### Compiling and Running Code
To compile and run an implementation:

```bash
zig build-exe <filename>.zig
./<filename>
```
